/* FPL Restyle - CSS Template for URL-Specific Styling */
/* 
This file is now a template. The actual CSS injection is handled by content.js
which injects styles based on the current URL.

To add styles for different pages, edit the content.js file and add new style blocks
to the 'styles' object. Each block should be named and contain the CSS for that page.

Example structure in content.js:
const styles = {
  myTeam: `...CSS for my-team page...`,
  league: `...CSS for league page...`,
  transfers: `...CSS for transfers page...`,
  global: `...CSS for all pages...`
};

URL patterns that are currently supported:
- /my-team or ends with /my-team
- /leagues or /league/
- /transfers or /transfer/

To add new URL patterns, edit the injectStylesForCurrentPage() function in content.js
